  <h1>Paul Dubinski</h1>
  <p id="title-font">Owner/Training Coordinator</p>
  <p id="about-text">
    Paul has been a well-known dog trainer in the Portland area for over 15 years.
    He works with all breeds and behavioral issues, but specifically specializes in aggression rehabilitation,
    for which he has a great passion.
    No dog is too much of a challenge for Paul and he relishes the challenge of helping struggling dogs
    reach their potential and lead happy, well-balanced lives with their families.<br>
    Previously, Paul was a German Shepherd breeder, line-breeding stock imported directly from Germany,
    but now focuses his energy solely on training and rescuing Shepherds in need. In his free time,
    Paul enjoys watching the Trail Blazers, live music shows, collecting military memorabilia and
    spending time with his personal pack of German Shepherds, all of whom he personally bred.
