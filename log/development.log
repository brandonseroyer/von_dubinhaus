He&#39;s actually quite a submissive dog towards humans and other dogs as well. He is good with our Alpha female and should be fine with other females dogs of decent size. A household without cats is always preferred with our rescues, but he actually does pretty well with cats, a dog-savvy cat should be no problem with him. Households with male dogs or very young kids will not be considered. Bear-Bear also has a history of fence jumping, so his new home will need fencing of good height. Lifetime training is included in Bear-Bear&#39;s adoption, so we will happily continue helping his new family lead him for his remaining years. If Bear-Bear goes to the right situation, with the right leadership, he will do just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is precious to us at Von Dubinhaus, we care for and rehabilitate a number of animals and get a large amount of inquires, so please only contact us if you are truly interested in Bear-Bear and can provide the needed circumstances for his future success.</p>\r\n", "user_id"=>"1", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007f8f0e123730 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/9_/9q1s6h_52gbf9xgpdpccjhyc0000gp/T/RackMultipart20160402-1174-l94l60.jpg>, @original_filename="bear.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"dog[image]\"; filename=\"bear.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Dog", "id"=>"40"}

This handsome 4 year old boy is looking for a second chance and a place to call his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear-Bear is playful, goofy and super affectionate. He&#39;s actually quite a submissive dog towards humans and other dogs as well. He is good with our Alpha female and should be fine with other females dogs of decent size. A household without cats is always preferred with our rescues, but he actually does pretty well with cats, a dog-savvy cat should be no problem with him. Households with male dogs or very young kids will not be considered. Bear-Bear also has a history of fence jumping, so his new home will need fencing of good height. Lifetime training is included in Bear-Bear&#39;s adoption, so we will happily continue helping his new family lead him for his remaining years. If Bear-Bear goes to the right situation, with the right leadership, he will do just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is precious to us at Von Dubinhaus, we care for and rehabilitate a number of animals and get a large amount of inquires, so please only contact us if you are truly interested in Bear-Bear and can provide the needed circumstances for his future success.</p>\r\n", "user_id"=>"1", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fd7f829a608 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/9_/9q1s6h_52gbf9xgpdpccjhyc0000gp/T/RackMultipart20160406-4940-84jst8.jpg>, @original_filename="bear.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"dog[image]\"; filename=\"bear.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Dog", "id"=>"40"}

He&#39;s actually quite a submissive dog towards humans and other dogs as well. He is good with our Alpha female and should be fine with other females dogs of decent size. A household without cats is always preferred with our rescues, but he actually does pretty well with cats, a dog-savvy cat should be no problem with him. Households with male dogs or very young kids will not be considered. Bear-Bear also has a history of fence jumping, so his new home will need fencing of good height. Lifetime training is included in Bear-Bear&#39;s adoption, so we will happily continue helping his new family lead him for his remaining years. If Bear-Bear goes to the right situation, with the right leadership, he will do just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time is precious to us at Von Dubinhaus, we care for and rehabilitate a number of animals and get a large amount of inquires, so please only contact us if you are truly interested in Bear-Bear and can provide the needed circumstances for his future success.</p>\r\n", "user_id"=>"1", "image"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fd7f7465380 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/var/folders/9_/9q1s6h_52gbf9xgpdpccjhyc0000gp/T/RackMultipart20160406-4940-8g4at7.jpg>, @original_filename="bear.jpg", @content_type="image/jpeg", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"dog[image]\"; filename=\"bear.jpg\"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Dog", "id"=>"40"}
